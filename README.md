# MyCard

## Description

MyCard is a React Native mobile app for easily sharing contact information via a QR code. Rather than manually entering an acquaintance's name, number, and email into you address book, MyCard enables quick scan-and-save functionality. The app is a type of "digital business card," in a sense.

## Background

I built this project as a portfolio for CS361: Software Engineering. I followed an Agile development process comprised of 5 two-week prints. I also utilized numerous design and planning methodologies, including paper prototyping, UML diagrams, and task prioriziation frameworks.

## Toolchain Selection

**Why Typescript:**

- Error Catching: Typescript makse it much easier to catch errors before runtime, especially when using 3rd-party libraries with complex types.
- Documenting: Codifying the type and shape of objects within Typescript serves as future documentation for other developers or my future self.

**Why React Native:**

- Time-to-market: I was familar with React, but had never built a mobile application before. React Native allowed me to start developing quicker.
- Cross-platform: One of the key benefits of this app is its cross-platform nature, allowing users to share contacts whether iOS or Android.

**Why Expo:**

- Development Experience: Expo's CLI made it much easier to set up, run, and debug my application.
- Feature-rich Libraries: Expo's SDK had a library for nearly every feature I wanted to implement - camera integration, system contacts integration, file storage, etc.
